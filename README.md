Install windows on dvd using vm save method. You can save your data


Hello guys! This is my first repo in github. Looking forward to a nice journey! 

This guide tells you how to use windows on a dvd-rw drive. 
You might be thkining that I'll use a Windows PE (preinstalltion environment) image on my DVD drive. 

But as you know, windows PE uses ramdisk to store data and all data gets wiped after each reboot or shutdown. So I've come up with a method to use windows from a DVD drive without loosing data on rebooting or shutdown.

Prerequisites:

1. A Dvd-rw drive (8 gb minimum)
